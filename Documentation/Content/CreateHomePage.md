# Create a Home Page
Upon installing Cosmos, creating a home page is the last step in the process of setting up Cosmos for the first time. You can also create new home pages later on as well. The following descibes how to do so.

## First Home Page
When Cosmos is installed it contains no web pages, and when you open the "Editor" automatically you will be taken to the "Page List."

Here you will see no pages listed. There is a button at the top that says "Create Page." Click on this and follow the dialog.

Tip: If you selected a ready-made layout during install, chances are that layout contains a "home page" template. Select that as your first page then edit it to suit your needs.
