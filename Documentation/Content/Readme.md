# Create and Edit Content

Three paths are availble for creating content that can be hosted with Cosmos.  You can use which one(s) work best for you. An overview of each is given here.

## Code Editor

The code editor allows editing of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and TypeScript using the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which "is the code editor that powers VS Code" ([Monaco Editor, Microsoft, 11 April, 2022](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)).

This editor is best used by software engineers who are developing web pages that are rich JavaScript/CSS/HTML content for Cosmos.

Also use the code editor to "mark" `<div></div>` blocks as "content editable" for the [HTML Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/WYSIWYG(HTMLEditor).md) like this:

`<div contenteditable="true"><!-- everything in here can be edited by the HTML editor --></div>`

Here are some quick facts about this editor:

* It is compatible with any HTML 5 modern web browser.
* Is is not compatible with mobile web browsers, or mobile devices (i.e. cell phones).
* Microsoft provides [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) on how to use this editor.
