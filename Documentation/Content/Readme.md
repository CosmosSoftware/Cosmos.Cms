# Create and Edit Content

Three paths are availble for creating content that can be hosted with Cosmos.  You can use which one(s) work best for you. An overview of each is given here.

## Code Editor

The code editor allows editing of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and TypeScript using the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which "is the code editor that powers VS Code" ([Monaco Editor, Microsoft, 11 April, 2022](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)).
