# WYSIWYG (HTML Editor)

Cosmos comes with two editors: the HTML Editor and Code Editor. Alternatively, you can develop with VS Code and import directly into Cosmos.  See [our documentation](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/Creating-with-VS-Code.md) on how to do that.

Below explains how to use the *HTML Editor*, also known as the "WYSIWYG Editor."

## What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG)
Cosmos' HTML editor is meant to enable the *non-technical person* to create and edit content on their own.

Most people are familiar with using word processors such as Google Docs, Microsoft Word and WordPerfect. Each is considered a "[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)" editors because as you write and stylize the page, it displays exactly how the document is going to print or be viewable to another on a computer.

WYSIWYG editors are so handly because you can style a document while you write it, and you do not have to be an expert to do so.

Cosmos comes with the [Kendo UI WYSIWYG editor](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/index) that has some enhancements. It comes with many functions you may expect with word processors and you can test-drive those functions on the [product documentation website](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/all-tools).

### How to Enable
The HTML editor isn't enabled for every web page by default.  It is setup to only edit those sections of a web page that are "marked editable" using the [Code Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/CodeEditor.md).
