# Tutorial: Creating with VS Code ![VS Code Icon](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/vs-code-icon.png)

Cosmos has tools for developing web applications and content with an outside editor. In this tutorial we show how to create a web app with Visual Studio Code and npm, and then import these into Cosmos.

## Prerequisites

A few things need to be in place before performing this tutorial.  Here they are:

* Visual Studio Code is installed on your computer
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your computer
* [Angular](https://angular.io) installed as well.
 
## Step 1: Create a web page using Cosmos
 
Begin the process by creating a new web page with Cosmos that will house your content and/or web app. If you already have a page you want to use, then skip to step 3 "Open page in code editor."
 
 * Click the "Menu" button and select "Pages."
 * From the page list page, click the "New Page" button.
 * You will see the following dialog:

 * In the above dialog give the page a title.
 * There is no need to choose a page template, so click "Create" and you should see the HTML editor open it up.

 * Click the "Menu" button and "Save."
 * Then, click "Menu" then "Code View" to open the code editor.
 * Next, click the "Code Editor" button and click "Export."

This will download a web page ready that you will need later. Remember where you downloaded it.

## Step 2: Create an Angular web app

## Step 3: Build your app with npm

## Step 4: Import the web page

## Step 5: Import the assets

## Step 6: Adjust paths

## Step 7: Preview
