# ![VS Code Icon](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/vs-code-icon.png) Creating with VS Code

Cosmos has tools for developing web applications and content with an outside editor. We show how to create Angular, React, Vue and other web apps with Visual Studio Code and npm, then import these into Cosmos.

Here is how to do it:
 
 ## Create a web page using Cosmos
 
 Begin the process by creating a new web page with Cosmos. If you already have a page you want to use, then skip this step.
 
 1. Click the "Menu" button and select "Pages."
 2. From the page list page, click the "New Page" button.
 3. Open the page in the Code Editor.
 4. Click the "Menu" button and "Save."
 5. Next, click the "Menu" button and click "Export."
