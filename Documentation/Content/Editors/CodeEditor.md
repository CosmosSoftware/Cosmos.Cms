# Code Editor

The code editor allows editing of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and TypeScript using the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which "is the code editor that powers VS Code" ([Monaco Editor, Microsoft, 11 April, 2022](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)).

This editor is best used by software engineers who are developing web pages that are rich JavaScript/CSS/HTML content for Cosmos.

Also use the code editor to "mark" `<div></div>` blocks as "content editable" for the [HTML Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/WYSIWYG(HTMLEditor).md) like this:

`<div contenteditable="true"><!-- Everything in here can be edited by the HTML editor --></div>`

Here are some quick facts about the code editor:

* Is compatible with any HTML 5 modern web browser.
* Is NOT compatible with mobile web browsers or mobile devices (i.e. cell phones).
* Microsoft provides [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) on how to use this editor.

## How to open the editor

Start by either navigating to the page you want to modify using the "Editor" or by selecting the web page by choosing "Menu" then "Pages," then selecting "Edit" button by the page you want to work with.

This will open a list of "versions" of that page.

Look at the "Edit Tools" column. You should see a button for the "Code Editor." Click on that to open the editor.
