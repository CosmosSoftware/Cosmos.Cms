# Create a Layout
The following shows how to create your own layout. If you are not familar with how layouts are used, please see our [documentation](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/About.md) before getting started.

## Prerequisits
The following will be needed before proceeding:
* [Cosmos is installed](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Installation/AzureClickInstall.md)
* [Post installation steps](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Installation/AzureClickInstall.md#required-post-installation-steps) are completed.
* You have basic familiarity with CSS, HTML and JavaScript
* You are able to log into Cosmos as an administrator

## Plan Your Layout
Before deciding on look and feel, colors and fonts, and so forth, make some decisions about how you want your website structured. 

Here are some things to consider--each will affect how your layout is built:

* Will your website have common elements appear on each page, examples include:
  *  Banner
  *  Navigation bar
  *  Footer
  *  Google Analytics or other tools
*  Do you have a certain framework you want to use such as Bootstrap or other?
*  Will you require custom JavaScript and/or CSS to appear on each page?

Here are further tips in planning your layout:

* Keep it lean, and only include what is absolutely necessary to appear on each web page.
* If your Cosmos site will host web applications, create a layout that uses "plain JavaScript and CSS." This will reduce conflicts between your layout and each page.
* Cosmos does not require any kind of framework. Use one you are most familiar with.

## Step by Step
While you can design your layout as you build it, it is best to make certain decisions before you start.  Each isn't really specific to Cosmos as it applies to all website design:

1. Log into Cosmos, and from the drop down menu in the upper left, choose "Layouts."
2.
