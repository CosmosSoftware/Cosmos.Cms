# Import Layout into Cosmos

The following shows how to import a pre-built layout. If you are not familar Cosmos layouts, please see our *quick* read [about layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/About.md) before continuing.

Several [pre-built layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/StarterLayouts.md) are available to import into Cosmos. Each is open-source and is customizable. Alternatively you can [create your own layout](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md).

Once you install Cosmos and configure it, it will ask for you to import a layout.  You can do so [or create your own](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md).

In this case we are going to import one of the [starter layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/StarterLayouts.md).

There are several to choose from, and each is open-source. Once imported you are free to modify them to your need.
