# Import Layout into Cosmos

Several [pre-built layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/StarterLayouts.md) are available to import into Cosmos. Each is open-source and is customizable. Alternatively you can [create your own layout](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md).
